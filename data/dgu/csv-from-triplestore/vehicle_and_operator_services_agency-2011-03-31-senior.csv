"8","Alastair Peoples","SCS2","VOSA Chief Executive","VOSA contributes to saving lives, making roads safer, cutting crime and protecting the environment through ensuring compliance with regulations of drivers, operators, vehicles, MOT garages and maintainers. VOSA delivers compliance through licensing, testing and education services, and, where necessary, take enforcement action against those who are non-compliant, for example through issuing fixed penalties or through the immobilisation of vehicles. We also ensure that we review our activities in line with changing patterns of non-compliance and accident causation, for example, the increasing numbers of non-GB vehicles on our roads.","Department for Transport","Vehicle and Operator Services Agency","Chief Executive","0117 9543211","Alastair.Peoples@vosa.gsi.gov.uk","XX","55823107","1","90000","94999","","Operational Delivery","","","http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/public-body/vehicle-operator-services-agency/post/8","/data/dft/2011-03-31/Final-VOSA-Transparency-Return-26-May-2011.xls","person2"
