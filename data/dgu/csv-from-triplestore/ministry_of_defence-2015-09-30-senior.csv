This is being achieved by:  Organisational transformation: creating an entirely new architecture practise and Design Authority for the MOD that will ensure coherence to a single architecture framework across all the armed forces (army, navy and air force) and deliver a common base and standardize architecture and by introducing design gate approvals.  HR Transformation: Re-skilling the technical teams and equipping them to address the challenge of creating designs rather than just assuring them.  Challenging current technology direction: Setting the standard and creating a reference architecture against which vendors will be required to deliver solutions. This reference architecture works from the tactical edge to the HQ and will create a single information environment that can be delivered in a WAN, Satellite or narrow bandwidth radio environment. In addition, the CTO is working across the pillars (Design-Deliver-Run) to work with the ongoing SIAM transformation that to embed ITIL processes and tools across the organisation.
